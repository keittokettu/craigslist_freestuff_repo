# craigslist freestuff repo
findings of web-scraping Craiglist's free stuff listings, geographically focusing on the Midwest, Western and Central PA, and Rust Belt regions of the USA

since last time, I mostly expanded the scope of my dataset, and now am proud to have a heap of free stuff images (n=862). however, I had to expand my gaze out from western PA; still wanting to preserve the hyper-regional 'feel' of the objects, I picked regions adjacent to here (regionally and culturally).
