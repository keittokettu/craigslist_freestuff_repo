# craigslist freestuff repo
findings of web-scraping Craiglist's free stuff listings, geographically focusing on the Midwest, Western and Central PA, and Rust Belt regions of the USA

since last time, I mostly expanded the scope of my dataset, and now am proud to have a heap of free stuff images (n=862). however, I had to expand my gaze out from western PA; still wanting to preserve the hyper-regional 'feel' of the objects, I picked regions adjacent to here (regionally and culturally).

*map of used locations and sample sizes for each: akron, buffalo, cleveland, columbus, dayton, erie, morgantown, pittsburgh, scranton, state college, toledo, wheeling, youngstown. I was surprised to learn that the pittsburgh craiglist held the most free stuffâ€“ I feel like I'm blessed to live in the middle of this arbitrary universe I've defined.*

these come from my LoRA made w/ my previous only-pittsburgh version of this dataset, but I think these are representative of what emerges from a model trained on these images:

*some text-containing images get absorbed by the model. also, people generated are often (1) white and (2) older *

*crude scribbles of red arrows and circles made by craiglist posters get ingested into the model's visual language*

*generated homes, or living room environments, often have a beige-cream carpeted floor*

*working with this dataset, you learn of its unique iconography, such as # FREE DIRT *
